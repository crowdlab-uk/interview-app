## Interview Test App

This is a simple react front end app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It simply lists out some "Posts".

It uses [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as a fake Rest API, to provide the data for the front end.

## Candidate Instructions

When completing the tasks, don't worry too much about trying to match the existing coding style, just try and get the job done.

### Data Fetching / Providing

This app is currently using browser fetch, react hooks and render props to provide data. If you want to implement it in the same way that's ok. But if you'd prefer to implement it a different way, thats ok too. Don't feel any pressure to use any data containers (eg. redux), keep it as simple as you like.

### Styling

The app currently has no styling to speak of. Generally we add styles by using styled components. If you'd like to add styles to the pieces you add, great, but its not necessary. You can add styles using styled-components, any other css in js library you are familiar with or by using class names and the stylesheet.

### Testing

You can unit or integration test this if you would like, but it is not required. But please do have a think about what (if any) bits you would test.
